### Question
5.2 Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number. Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below.
### Solution
largest = None
smallest = None
while True:
    try:
        num = raw_input("Enter a number: ")
        if num == "done":
            break
        
        num = int(num)
        if largest is None or largest < num:
            largest = num
        elif smallest is None or smallest > num:
             smallest = num
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input")
 
print ("Maximum is", largest)
print ("Minimum is", smallest)
